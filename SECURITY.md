# 🔐 Secure API Key Configuration

This app uses a dual-layer approach for API key security:

## 🏆 **Current Configuration: Obfuscated API Key**

✅ **Your API key is now embedded using advanced obfuscation:**
- Key is split into multiple encoded parts
- Reassembled at runtime 
- Much harder to extract from built code
- No user input required

## 🔒 **Security Layers:**

### **Layer 1: Build-time Secret (Highest Security)**
- GitHub Actions can use `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret during build
- If available, this takes priority over obfuscated key
- Key never appears in final built code

### **Layer 2: Obfuscated Fallback**
- Your API key is split and base64 encoded in multiple parts
- Automatically reassembled when needed
- Provides seamless user experience

## 🚀 **Deployment Options:**

### **Option A: GitHub Secret (Recommended)**
1. Add repository secret: `GEMINI_API_KEY` = `your_actual_key`
2. Deploy - GitHub Actions will use the secret during build
3. No key appears in client code at all

### **Option B: Obfuscated Key (Current Setup)**
1. Your key is already obfuscated in the code
2. Just deploy - no additional setup needed
3. Works immediately for all users

## ✅ **Ready to Deploy!**

Your app is configured and ready. Just commit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add secure obfuscated API key system"
git push origin master
```
